            <h1>Purpose</h1>
            <p>History is confusing, and so is reading through articles and trying to understand it. Fortunatly for you, I like confusing and have compiled noteworthy summaries of mine on this website. So now instead of knowing that history is confusing, you can now understand WHY it is confusing (as well as any other fun details I throw in).</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Who Are You?</h1>
            <p>Who, who, who, who?</p>
            <p>References aside, I am Github user Jvader314, and I like programing websites in HTML for some reason. Wix, Weebley, and Google Sites are for cowards (or people who want a good looking website and can't waste time learning to code).</p>
