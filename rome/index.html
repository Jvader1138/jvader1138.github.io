            <h1>The First and Only Complete European Empire</h1>
            <p>According to legend, the city of Rome was founded in 753 BC by Romulus. Whether or not this is true is unimportant, as he played no significant role in the creation of the lasting legacy of the Roman Empire. At its height, the Roman Empire spanned from modern day England to Egypt. They built a great deal of things, form aqueducts to roads, and laid the foundations for modern militaries to rise.</p>

            <h1>A Brief History</h1>
            <p>Through the early years of Rome, small scale raids developed into a national armed forces. At its peak in 200 AD, the Roman army had 33 legions of over 5,000 men. These volunteers went through a rigorous training program to make the Roman war machine the most efficient, obediant, and effective army of the time. However, through the combination of invading barbarians, poor hygeine, lead poisioning, and the lack of a gene pool, Rome fell in 476 AD.</p>

            <h1>Legion Structure (Imperial Era c.30 BC to 476 AD)</h1>
            <p>The smallest organizational unit of the legion is the contubernium, comprised of 8 legionaries and 2 servants (although we don't count them). Contubernia are led by their elected decanus, who is usually the most senior legionary of the group. Contubernia members, or contubernales, shared a tent and a pack mule.</p>
            <p>10 contubernia are grouped together to form a century (80 legionaries) led by a centurion, who was usually appointed from a wealthy family. The centurion appoints a Optio to be second in command, a tesserarius as captain of the guard, and a signifer to hold the standard. Optios typically marched near the rear of the century in order to keep the legionaries in line, while the centurion, the tesserarius, and the signifer marched at the front.</p>
            <p>A cohort (480 legionaries) was comprised of 6 centuries, led by the most senior centurion and advised by the other 5. The cohort is the smallest tactical unit used by upper level officers and generals for the purpose of strategy.</p>
            <p>The legion (5,120 legionaries) is the largest tactical unit used in the roman army, with around 30 in active service at one time. It consists of 1 "double strength" cohort (the first cohort), 9 standard cohorts, and 120 cavaliers (4 turmae of 30 cavaliers, each led by a decurion). The first cohort (800 legionaries) protects legion officers and generaly recruits the most skilled soldiers and officers. In charge of the first cohort was usually the veteran centurion, refered to as the "primus pilus," or first spear. It is made up of 5 centuries comprised of 20 contubernia each , each led by a senior centurion (primi ordines), save the primus pilus' century. A legion also has 9 leadership positions. The praefectus castrorum, or camp prefect, is usually an older veteran in charge of running the camp and its supplies. An aquilifer held the legion's standard, the aquila, or eagle. The legion employed 6 potential senators to lead them: 5 tribuni angusticlavii aided a tribuni laticlavius, who acted as second in command of the legion. Finally, the legatus, who was often a senator or career soldier, led the legion.</p>
