            <h1>A Brief History</h1>
            <p>The Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815) saw almost every European power fight to either defend France or dethrone Napoleon Bonaparte. Napoleon wanted to rule a European Empire, and had control of an area stretching from Spain to Poland by 1812. He was finally defeated at the Battle of Waterloo by the British army.</p>

            <h1>Infantry Organization</h1>
            <p>Regiments remained an important part of the British army, and were still lead by an appointed colonel. However, regiments starting in the mid Napoleonic Wars included multiple battalions, as opposed to just one at the start of the conflict. However, battalions (3-4) were often regrouped to form brigades.</p>
            <p>Battalions were lead by a lieutenant colonel and 2 majors. A lieutenant served as the adjutant. The battalion staff also included a paymaster (staff sergeant) and an armorer (sergeant), along with the noncombatant sugeons.</p>
            <p>10 companies of around 100 men were included in battalions (2 of which being the grenadier and light infantry companies.). These companies were lead by a captain, a lieutenant, and an ensign. Companies also had 2 sergeants and 3 corporals. Drummers and fifers were also present.</p>

            <h1>Cavalry Organization</h1>
            <p>The cavalry equivalent of a company was the squadron, commanded by a major. Squadrons were broken up into 2 troops, containing 1 captain, 1 (maybe 2) lieutenants, 1 cornet (ensign), 1 sergeant-major, 1 furrier (quartermaster), 4 sergeants, 4 corporals, 1 trumpeter, and 85 troopers. 5 Squadrons made up a cavalry regiment, although 1 squadron was left at home, giving the regiment a field strength of 4 squadrons. Regiments could also be grouped together to form a brigade.</p>

            <h1>Artillery Organization</h1>
            <p>The artillery equivalent of a company was the "brigade" (battery in modern terms), which was usually commanded by a Major. brigades were broken up into 3 "divisions" (troops in the royal horse artillery) of 2 guns, commanded by a captain and multiple lieutenants. The brigade was also given 6-9 ammunition wagons. Brigades typically utilized 4 "6 pounder" cannons and 2 howitzers.</p>
