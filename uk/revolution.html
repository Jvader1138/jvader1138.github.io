            <h1>A Brief History</h1>
            <p>As colonization became more important to England, thier naval presence increased to outclass all other countries. What they could not achieve at sea, they could on the ground with the infamous Redcoats. Both branches saw action in the Seven Years War and the American War for Independance. The military in this state would server until reforms before the Napoleonic Wars.</p>

            <h1>Army Organization</h1>

            <h2>Regiments and Companies</h2>
            <p>The basic strategical unit of the 1700s was the regiment, containing about 500 men. They were usually raised and administered by a colonel, who would also sometimes fund them. Thus colonels tended to be the rich or the nobility. Regiments developed strong identities as a result of bearing their own unique flag, wearing unique uniforms, and recruiting from a specific area of the British Isles. </p>
            <p>Regiments were broken up into 10 companies of around 50 men: 2 flank companies and 8 regular companies. Flank companies in the regiment were the grenadiers and the light infantry, which were generally lead by experience captains and 2 lieutenants. Each regular company was commanded by a captain, with the exception of comanies commanded by the colonel, lieutenant colonel, and major. These offivers led both the regiment and their company. Each regular company then had a lieutenant (a captain-lieutenant in the colonel's company, as the colonel was seldom present to lead his own company) as 2nd in command and an ensign as 3rd in command. All of the officers mentioned would have to purchase their commission, making it so only the wealthy English could become officers. Additionaly, companies had a number of non-commissioned officers in charge of discipline. These included about 2 sergeants and 3 corporals. Drummers and fifers were also present.</p>
            <p>The regiment also had some special positions, such as the adjutant and quartermaster. These roles were filled by lieutenants in addition to their company duties, but were often given to deserving sergeants as the war in America progressed. Other positions such as surgeons and chaplains (chaplains were less common in America) were filled by trained experts.</p>

            <h2>Battalions</h2>
            <p>Battalions are often confused with regiments in this era, as they refer to a similar amount of troops. A battalion refers to the 8 regular companies of a regiment. This happens durring war when regiments are broken up for tactical organization. The 2 flank companies could be separated from their regiment in order to form what is know as flank battalions. For example a grenadier battalion would be comprised of 8-12 grenadier companies, lead by a colonel or lieutenant colonel, with a major or captain as 2nd in command. These positions were held by officers appointed from other regiments.</p>
