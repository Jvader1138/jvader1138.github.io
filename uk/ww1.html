            <h1>A Brief History</h1>
            <p>The British Military shifted more towards modern organization during the Victorian Era, and was tested during "The Great War". Artillery and trench warfare played a major part in this war, as well as dreadnoughts, airplanes, and tanks. Cavlry was used early in the war, but was not as effective as it was in the past. Machine guns dominated the battlefied, stopping most advances and leading to a bloody stalemate on the western front.</p>

            <h1>Infantry Organization.</h1>
            <p>The infantry became much more easily divisible, with lower officers and NCO's given command of a standard number of men. The smallest unit was the section (12 men), lead by a corporal with a lance corporal as 2nd in command. 4 sections were gruped together to form a platoon, lead by a lieutenant (or second lieutenant) and a sergeant. Platoon and company officers were often accompanied by a batman (bodyguard) and a messenger. 4 platoons were grouped together to form a company, lead by a major (sometimes a captain), with a captain and company sergeant major typically assiting him. All together this included over 200 men. 4 companies were grouped together (plus on machine gun section containing 16 men, a lieutenant, and 2 machine guns) to form a battalion, which was commanded by a lieutenant colonel. The battalion also had a major as second in command, an adjutant (lieutenant), a quartermaster (lieutenant), and a regimental sergeant major (WO1). The headquarters company also included signalers, pioneers, and drivers.</p>
            <p>Regiments were composed of a number battalions, but the battalions were typically re-organizied into brigades. Brigades were commanded by a brigadier, and were composed of 4 battalions (3 late war). Multiple brigades and battalions of many types were grouped together to form divisions, which were able to operate independantly.</p>

            <h1>Cavalry Organization</h1>
            <p>A cavalry section contained 8 men (with horses) and was commanded by a corperal. Troops were made up of 4 sections, and were commanded by a lieutenant (or 2nd lieutenant). 4 troops were grouped together to make a squadron, which was commanded by a major (typically) and had a captain as its 2nd in command. A cavalry regiment contained 3 squadrons and a machine gun section. It was lead by a lieutenant colonel and had a major as its 2nd in command. 3 regiments would form a brigade.</p>

            <h1>Artillery Organization</h1>
            <p>For crying out loud, why can't anyone write anything down...</p>
